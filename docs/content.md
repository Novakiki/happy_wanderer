# Content Rules (MVP)

This site uses three entry types. Keep them distinct so the narrative remains clear.

## Memory
- A firsthand moment, scene, or observation about Valerie.
- Should be grounded in what the contributor directly experienced.
- OK to be brief. Specific beats broad.

## Anchor
- A dated life event or transition (birth, passing, historical pin, move, diagnosis timeline, etc.).
- Use it when the timing or fixed placement is the point.
- Keep the tone factual and restrained.

## Synchronicity-Based Storytelling (Origin)
- A meaningful association from an external source (song, word, article, book, etc.).
- Not a memory. It is a patterned resonance that helps name something about her.
- Must include the source and the reason it belongs (why the association matters).

## Safety + Tone
- Warm, calm, factual. No sensationalism.
- Never invent details or speak as Valerie.
- Attribute memories to a source when possible.
- If a request is sensitive or unclear, ask before writing.
